# Contributing

This GitHub repository is a read‑only mirror an upstream project hosted on a private GitLab instance. All development and CI/CD run there.

I’m happy to receive **issues** and **pull requests** as feedback, examples or inspiration, but please note:

- I usually **do not merge** external pull requests.
- I may cherry‑pick ideas or changes at my discretion.
- If you want to maintain your own changes, please **fork** the repository.

If you find a bug or have a question, the best way to help is to open an issue. Thanks!
